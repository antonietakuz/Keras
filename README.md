# Keras
- Keras is an Open Source Neural Network library written in Python.
- It is able to run on top of TensorFlow, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit or Theano.
- It is specially designed to allow experimentation in a more or less short time with Deep Learning networks.
- Deep learning is a set of machine learning algorithms that attempt to model high-level abstractions in data using computational architectures that feature multiple, iterative nonlinear transformations of augmented data matrix or tensor
